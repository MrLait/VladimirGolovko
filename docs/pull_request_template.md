# TASK 1

## How many items from requirements was completed?
*  All of which are described in the "Requirements" section

## Possible Drawbacks/Concerns (What should reviewers look out for?)
* Pay attention to the validation and it would be nice if you can comment on the best way to implement it.

## Testing Notes (How do we know this works & doesn't break other things)
* All tests must be passed at any number of repetitions.
